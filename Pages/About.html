                <p>
                    My initial interest in psychotherapy started early on in
                    high school when I discovered the world of psychology.
                    Fast-forward a few years, and I was picking cognitive
                    behavioral therapy as my major at university. I find that
                    psychotherapy has such a profound and positive impact on the
                    psyche of any individual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my work, I like to place emphasis on self-reliance and
                    self-discovery, meaning that I prefer to take the role of a
                    facilitator or a mentor, rather than being the one with the
                    answers. My methodology follows the current research in the
                    field overall, and I take care of keeping on top of all new
                    developments in the field.

                    <p>

                        judgment, empowering people to recognize their creative

                    <h3>Quantum Healing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Quantum healing is a holistic approach that views the
                        universe as energy, with consciousness playing a key
                        role in shaping reality. It facilitates personal
                        transformation by revisiting and rewriting memories
                        through the practitioner's higher self and the client's
                        Akashic Record. The process aims to rewire neural
                        pathways by actively reshaping subconscious memories,
                        releasing trauma without guilt and emphasizing the
                        importance of rewriting one's personal narrative.

                        body's natural healing ability at physical, mental,
                        emotional and spiritual levels. It is a no-touch,
                        no-drug healing therapy that has shown success in
                        treating a wide range of physical, psychological and
