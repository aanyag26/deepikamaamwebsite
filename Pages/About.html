                    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Nice to meet you</h1>
                    <p style="float: left; padding-left: 5px;">My initial interest in psychotherapy started early on in high school when I discovered the world of psychology. Fast-forward a few years and I was picking cognitive behavioral therapy as my major at university. I find that psychotherapy has such a profound and positive impact on the psyche of any individual.</p>
                    <p style="float:left; padding-left: 5px;" >In my work, I like to place emphasis on self-reliance and self-discovery, meaning that I prefer to take the role of a facilitator or a mentor, rather than being the one with the answers. My methodology follows the current research in the field overall, and I take care of keeping on top of all new developments in the field.</p>

        <p1 style="margin-right: 5px; float: right; text-align: right;">
            Quantum healing is a holistic approach that views the universe as energy, with 
            consciousness playing a key role in shaping reality. It facilitates personal 
            transformation by revisiting and rewriting past memories through the practitioner's
             higher self and the client's Akashic Record. The process aims to rewire neural pathways 
             by actively reshaping subconscious memories, releasing trauma without guilt and emphasizing 
             the importance of rewriting one's personal narrative.</p1>

        <p1 style="margin-left: 5px; float: left;">Pranic Healing is a system that
             uses the life-force energy known as prana to balance, harmonize and 
             transform the body's energy processes, accelerating the body's natural
              healing ability at physical, mental, emotional and spiritual levels.
